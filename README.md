# yolo_nas_live_webcam
This code exploits how yolo nas can be used to make predictions on a live webcam.
The pre-trained weights for the sample and the images are uploaded to the drive with the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ebe26zZ1P1Rct_iJoFXEm8PaFs-BHv7m?usp=sharing. The code works on the Yolo nas small model, for better accuracy medium or large can be used just by changing the name in the 'model' line in the code. Sample image for that is:

The above image is trained on the small model for protective gear detection. If seen carefully it is not detecting the glove. The medium-weight model can perfect this:
